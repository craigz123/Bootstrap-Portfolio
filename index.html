    <p>
      As a restaurant operator, I've managed and served customers, employees and vendors all of my life. I've always
      enjoyed it, but now I feel that it's time for a change. I want to keep on serving others in a new way
      by learning a skill that allows me the freedom
      to work from office, home or remote places. I want to apply my web design trade as not only a way to make a living
      but to
      volunteer my services to those in need like business start-ups with
      little to no way of paying or for charities and non-profits looking to raise funds.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>My goal is to gain enough experience to fit into a role of someone who creates websites that promote
        entrepreneurship and also help in building strong communities.</strong>
